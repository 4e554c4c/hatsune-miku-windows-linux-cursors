This cursor set is a modified version of a Windows cursor set created by [love0922c的小屋](https://home.gamer.com.tw/creationDetail.php?sn=1760192) with a Book and Kotatsu cursors found [here](https://paradise-cheaters.blogspot.com/2014/09/software-cursor-hatsune-miku-pack.html) with a few original ones made by myself!

Hope you like it!
